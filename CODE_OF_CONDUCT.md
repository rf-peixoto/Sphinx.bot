# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors and leaders, are committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of any types of characteristics inherent to the individuality of each member.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrate politeness and cordiality in all interactions.
* Focus all discussions on the details that are absolutely relevant to the project, leaving matters and discussions unrelated to the project to external discussions.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Any types of offenses, even if in a humorous context (with or without permission from those involved).
* Use of bad language, sexual language or offensive terms.
* Discussions not related to the project. This includes political, religious, social debates and any other topics that do not fit solely and exclusively within the scope of the project.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. That said, they have the right to permanently and summarily ban any member who violates the restrictions of this code, without prior notice, if necessary.
