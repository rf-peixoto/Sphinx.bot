## Before suggesting any changes, please check that the following steps have been completed:

1. You have consulted the TODO file for the platform whose change fits.
2. There is no similar pull request already submitted and under review to be merged into the main repository.

In addition, we avoid including external libraries except when strictly necessary. Give preference to the built-in features of the language (Python).
