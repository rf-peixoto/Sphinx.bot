# Security Policy

**Sphinx.bot** is developed with security as the main focus. Being a chat-bot, it has a single attack surface whose only possible entry would be the injection of malicious code. Database records are also manually handled to prevent malicious entries from within or log poisoning. However, **Sphinx.bot** is vulnerable to failures within the platforms on which it runs, as they are not under the control of the operator.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Because it runs on other platforms, **Sphinx.bot** takes advantage of their security structure, but, if a vulnerability is found, please open an issue with a complete description, CVE (if any) and a proof of concept. Failures will be dealt with immediately or according to the degree of severity.
